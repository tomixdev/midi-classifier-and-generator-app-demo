# The Purpose of This App
This application has two parts: midi classifier and midi generator. The midi classifier is designed to intelligently discern whether a given midi music file constitutes a complete piece of music. The midi generator, on the other hand, is capable of creating new midi files that resemble the style of the same midi dataset used to train the classifier. It thus is capable of generating midi files that embrace long-term structure.

# How to Use the Classifier
To utilize this app, simply follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Midi File**
2. **Upload YourFile**
3. **Analysis**: Once uploaded, the app instantly begins to analyze your file using a pretrained deep learning mode.
4. **Receive Your Results**: After a brief processing period, the app will display the results of the analysis, indicating whether the file is a complete piece of music or not.
